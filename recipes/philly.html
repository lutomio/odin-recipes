    <h1>Philly Cheese Steak Dip</h1>

    <div>
        <p>This Philly cheesesteak dip would make a 
            handsome addition to your snack table for the Big Game. 
            Like all great party foods, it's wonderful hot, warm, room temp, 
            and, I've heard from a reliable source, even delicious cold. Serve 
            alongside sliced baguette. Keep it hot and fresh for guests by baking 
            it in 2 batches, or feel free to do this all at once in a 9x13-inch 
            baking dish.</p>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <div>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>

        <p>Slice steak into thick pieces. 
            Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>

        <p>Heat olive oil in a pan over high heat until smoking. Add steak slices and sear until bottoms are browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip over and reduce heat to medium. 
            Cook until juices appear on the tops, 3 to 4 minutes more. 
            Transfer to a bowl to cool.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>

        <p>Add diced onion, a big pinch of salt, 
            and butter to the meat juices in the pan. 
            Cook and stir over medium heat, scraping up the browned bits, 
            until onions start to soften, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>

        <p>Dice up the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, 
            pepperoncini, pickled red peppers, and jalapenos 
            until you have 1 1/2 to 2 cups. 
            Add to the onions; cook and stir until starting to 
            soften, about 5 minutes.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>

        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>

        <p>Chop steak into small pieces. 
            Place back into the bowl with the accumulated meat juices.
             Add the onion-pepper mixture and cream cheese. 
             Grate in the provolone cheese, saving a little for the top. 
             Drizzle in Worcestershire sauce and sprinkle in cayenne pepper.
              Mix dip thoroughly.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>

        <p>Transfer 1/2 of the dip into a small baking dish.
             Smooth the top with a fork. Place baking dish 
             on top of a sheet pan. Sprinkle the remaining provolone
              cheese on top. Save the other 1/2 to bake fresh for your guests.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>

        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until dip is bubbling and 
            heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            Broil until top is browned, about 1 minute more. 
            Repeat with the second batch of dip.</p>
